# jUnit-Automated-Tests
My first automated tests using jUnit Quick Check.

This was part of a learning assigment in my automated testing course. I was using automated tests to catch injected faults into the Microwave project. The Microwave class is just a basic microwave written in code. It has a setup and cooking mode, has preset cooking options, and accepts input as time in seconds which are converted to digits in a digital clock format. My automated tests caught all 5 injected faults.
